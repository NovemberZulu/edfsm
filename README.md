edfsm - Event Driven Finite State Machine
===

Event driven Finite State Machines process commands (possibly created by other
events), performing some side effect, and emitting events.
Commands are processed against a provided state. Events can be applied to states
to yield new states.

For more background: [Event-driven Finite State Machines](http://christopherhunt-software.blogspot.com/2021/02/event-driven-finite-state-machines.html).

DSL
---

A macro has been provided that provides a Domain Specific Language mapping directly
from a Finite State Machine description to code. Please see the event_driven/tests folder for
examples.

no_std
---

The library is able to support`no_std`, particularly for usage on embedded targets.
